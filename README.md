Rock Paper Scissors Game, part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## How it works

It is played through the developer console.

The game goes on for a total of 5 rounds.

User is asked for their choice, if the user doesn't choose form `rock, paper, scissors`, they are prompted again and again.

After user enters correct choice(either rock, paper or scissors), the result for that round is shown in the console.

At the end of the 5th round, score is shown out of 5 and player is declared winner if he/she scores 3 or above.
